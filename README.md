How to Run the Simulation

• Set ADC ports in Edsim51 to P2 in same order (e.g. ADC1 in P1.1, then P2.1, ADC2 in P1.2, then P2.2 … so just change the P1 to P2) The last port config. is below.

• Set keypad mode to "Standard" and “AND Gate Enabled”

• Set UART baud rate is 19200 and No Parity (send char by char, do not send more than 1-character inputs)
